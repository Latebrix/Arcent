## ✨ What is Arcent?

Arcent helps you build positive momentum by documenting every victory in your life. Based on the psychological principle that celebrating small achievements builds self-confidence, the app encourages you to recognize every positive step on your journey.

Whether it's completing a workout, learning something new, finishing a project, or just having a good day - every win deserves celebration.
